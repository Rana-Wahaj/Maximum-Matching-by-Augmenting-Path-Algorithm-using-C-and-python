# Why DFS:
Used DFS to find augmenting paths in the bipartite graph. It explores unmatched vertices in set X, recursively searching for alternating paths to unmatched vertices in set Y. Augmenting paths are used to update the matching, maximizing the number of edges in the bipartite graph. The overall algorithm employs DFS to iteratively improve the matching until no more augmenting paths can be found.

The program allows user-defined or hard-coded input, showcasing the algorithm's flexibility. Utilizing Depth-First Search, the algorithm efficiently identifies augmenting paths for optimal matching. The output includes the original bipartite graph, the maximum matching, and the corresponding edges. The concise yet comprehensive code enables a clear understanding of the algorithm's application in solving bipartite graph matching problems.
Complexity Analysis:
# Space Complexity:
-Adjacency Matrix:
The space complexity of the adjacency matrix is O(X * Y), where X and Y are the number of vertices in sets X and Y. This matrix represents the bipartite graph and is used to store information about the edges.
-Matching Arrays:
The arrays `matchX`, `matchY`, `visitedX`, and `visitedY` contribute O(MAX) space complexity.
- Local Variables:
Local variables within functions, such as the `visitedY` array in the `augmentPath` and `maxMatching` functions, incur additional space during function execution.
# Time Complexity:
- Initialization:
The initialization of arrays in the constructor has a time complexity of O(MAX^2), as it involves nested loops iterating over MAX.
- DFS Algorithm:
The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm used to find augmenting paths has a time complexity of O(X * Y), where X and Y are the number of vertices in sets X and Y.
-Augmenting Path Algorithm:
The `augmentingPathAlgorithm` function runs the DFS algorithm for each unmatched vertex, resulting in a total time complexity of O(X * Y^2).
- Maximum Matching:
The `maxMatching` function iterates over all unmatched vertices and runs DFS, contributing to the overall time complexity of O(X * Y^2).
- Printing:
The printing functions, such as `printGraph` and `printMaximumMatchingEdges`, have a time complexity proportional to the number of edges in the graph.
# Overall:
The overall space complexity is dominated by the adjacency matrix, while the time complexity is primarily influenced by the DFS-based augmenting path algorithm. The algorithm's efficiency in finding augmenting paths and updating the matching arrays contributes to the overall performance of the code
